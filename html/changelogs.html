        <li>Removed: OPSKINS prices (for all the games) due to their recent conflict with Valve after which OPSKINS prices are not real and actual anymore.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>* This BETA service is located on the "Badges" page. The purpose of the function is to level up you profile with just a few clicks with the level you would choose by searching the cheapest card sets on the market.
        <ol>
          <li>Select the desired level.</li>
          <li>Check how much sets you need to level up.</li>
          <li>Press "LEVEL UP!" button.</li>

        <p>Please consider that this function is in BETA testing mode and will contain more cool stuff later.</p>
        <p>Please consider that Steam allows us to display and use only 100 card order on 1 page. So, for example, if you will need a 1000 card order to level up your profile, this feature will open 10 browser windows with all of the cards (sets).</p>
      </p>
      <p>** It will be displayed on the same spot where you can see the Float from CS:GO.</p>
      <p>*** Now you will be able to check how much your item worth in BP before buying and trade your items for the PUBG crates much easier by searching the cheapest ones on market.</p>

        are being requested in the mass listing function. They will be fresh and new anyways.</p>
